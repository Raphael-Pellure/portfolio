### Context

In an advanced image-processing workshop, we chose to **reimplement the “stress” color adjustment filter from GIMP in our own way**, to both replicate its visual effect and deepen our understanding of its internal mechanics. The core idea of the “stress” algorithm is to **enhance local color contrast** by, for each pixel:

1. Defining a circular neighborhood of radius **R**.

3. ei,fic,


This flexible Python implementation allows us to tweak R, N and M independently so we can study how each parameter shapes the final image.

### Tasks and Contributions

#### 1. Algorithm Design & Implementation  
- Developed **`local_color_adjustment(img, R, N, M)`** in Python using OpenCV and NumPy.  
- Defined neighborhood sampling (radius **R**) and color quantization into **N** clusters per pixel.  
- Computed and applied per-pixel corrections multiplied by gain **M**.  

#### 2. Quantitative Evaluation  
- Integrated **PSNR** (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and **SSIM** (Structural Similarity Index) from **scikit-image**.  
- Set up comparisons against both the **original image** and the **GIMP-processed image** for every (R, N, M) triplet.  

#### 3. Parametric Exploration  
- Designed a **parameter grid** over representative values of R, N and M.  
- Automated batch processing with Joblib, exporting all metrics to a **CSV**.  
- Visualized results via:  
  - **Heatmaps** of PSNR/SSIM (R × N) for fixed M.  
  - **Line plots** of PSNR & SSIM vs. R for each (N, M) combination.  

#### 4. Reproducibility & Packaging  
- Packaged code in a reusable module **`local_color_adjustment.py`**.  
- Documented experiments in Jupyter notebooks, enabling parallel execution and easy sharing of figures and results.

### Results

- Detailed **mapping** of how R, N and M influence color enhancement strength and artifact introduction.  
- Identification of **optimal parameter regions** offering strong color “punch” while preserving image fidelity.  
- Empirical comparison showing cases where our Python version yields closer fidelity to the original than GIMP’s built-in filter.

_This project not only replicates GIMP’s “stress” filter but also empowers us with a transparent, tunable Python implementation—demonstrating both the algorithm’s inner workings and the trade-offs inherent in local color adjustment._
